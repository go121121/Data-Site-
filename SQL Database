When we create a website, we want all the data store in the website can be seen as a coder. By doing below step, you can have great understanding on how to set up a sql database. 

1st step: 

Go to your app folder and find a file name model.py (front_task/web_application/models.py). And then type the code below: 

```
from django.db import models

class Member(models.Model):
  firstname = models.CharField(max_length=255)
  lastname = models.CharField(max_length=255)

```
